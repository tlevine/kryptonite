Kryptonite
=====

Through major advances in technology (blah blah),
we now live in a world where ordinary people are
constantly producing digital records of the world
around them. This situation has enabled the use
crowdsourcing to solve problems that could not be
solved before. And crowdsourcing is catching on
in law-enforcement. For example, law-enforcement
officials used social media data in the Boston
marathon investigation.

While they recognize the value of crowdsourced data,
the investigators did not have a good tool for
collecting the data; they simply published a press
release and set up a phone hotline.

We thought we could do better, so we created Kryptonite,
a crime alert and witness reporting system. To a civilian,
Kryptonite is a context-sensitive crime alert app that
she can install to on her phone. Kryptonite uses GPS to
see where the civilian is. If a crime happens nearby,
the civilian receives an alert from the police in real time.
Civilians install the app so they can stay safe.
But that's not all.

After the situation has cooled down, law enforcement can
send a request for information to the people who were near
the crime scene. Citizens are empowered to assist with the
investigation by calling a phone number, talking to an
investigator and providing any relevant information they have.

You can think of Kryptonite as a targeted press release.
When law-enforcement needs to keep civilians away from a
dangerous area, it can alert the specific people who are
at risk. And when they need evidence for an investigation,
they can alert the specific people who are likely to have
the evidence.
