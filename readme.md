Through major advances in technology (blah blah),
we now live in a world where ordinary people are
constantly producing digital records of the world
around them. This situation has enabled the use
crowdsourcing to solve problems that could not be
solved before. And crowdsourcing is catching on
in law-enforcement. For example, law-enforcement
officials used social media data in the Boston
marathon investigation.

While they recognize the value of crowdsourced data,
the investigators did not have a good tool for
collecting the data; they simply published a press
release and set up a phone hotline.
